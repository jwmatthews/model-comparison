## Reasoning

1. The first step is to address the issue found in the static code analysis, which is to replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`. This is because Quarkus does not support Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) and CDI must be used instead.
2. Next, we need to remove the `javax.ejb` package imports and replace them with the corresponding Quarkus/CDI package imports.
3. We also need to remove the `javax.jms` package imports and replace them with the corresponding Quarkus/SmallRye Reactive Messaging package imports.
4. We need to replace the `MessageListener` interface with the `io.quarkus.reactive.messaging.Incoming` annotation, which is used to indicate that a method should be called when a message is received on a specific channel.
5. We need to replace the `javax.jms.Message` parameter with a `String` parameter in the `onMessage` method, as the SmallRye Reactive Messaging API uses a `String` parameter instead of a `Message` parameter.
6. We need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the SmallRye Reactive Messaging dependency, as it is not included in the default Quarkus dependencies.

@ApplicationScoped
public class HelloWorldQueueMDB {

    private static final Log LOGGER = Log.log(HelloWorldQueueMDB.class);

    /**
     * @see MessageListener#onMessage(Message)
     */
    @Incoming("HELLOWORLDMDBQueue")
    public void onMessage(String rcvMessage) {
        if (rcvMessage != null) {
            LOGGER.info("Received Message from queue: " + rcvMessage);
        } else {
            LOGGER.warning("Message is null");
        }
    }
}
```

And in the `pom.xml` file, add the following dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-reactive-messaging-smallrye</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
Please note that this is a general approach and it may require some adjustments depending on the specific use case.

Also, please note that the `pom.xml` file is not provided in the input, so I assumed that you are using maven as a build tool, if you are using gradle or another build tool, the approach will be different.
