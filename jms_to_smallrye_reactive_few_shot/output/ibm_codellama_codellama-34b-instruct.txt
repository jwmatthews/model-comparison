## Reasoning

1. The first step is to identify the issue with the Java EE code. The issue is that the code uses Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) which are not supported in Quarkus. CDI must be used instead.
2. The next step is to identify the solved example. The solved example is a file named "src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/cmt/mdb/HelloWorldMDB.java" that shows how to replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.
3. The next step is to analyze the input file. The input file is named "src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/mdb/HelloWorldQueueMDB.java" and it contains a class named `HelloWorldQueueMDB` that implements the `MessageListener` interface.
4. The next step is to identify the line number of the issue first appearing in the Java EE code source code example. The line number is 34.
5. The next step is to update the input file to Quarkus. The first step is to replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`. The next step is to replace the `MessageListener` interface with the `Incoming` annotation.
