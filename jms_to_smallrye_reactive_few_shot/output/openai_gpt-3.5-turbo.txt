## Reasoning
1. The static code analysis highlighted that EJBs are not supported in Quarkus and CDI must be used instead.
2. The `@MessageDriven` annotation needs to be replaced with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.
3. The `MessageListener` interface and related JMS imports are no longer needed in Quarkus, as we will be using MicroProfile Reactive Messaging instead.
4. The `onMessage` method needs to be updated to accept a `String` parameter instead of a `Message` parameter.
